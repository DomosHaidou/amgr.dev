# Personal

## Work

I'm a Software Engineer who lives in Toronto, Canada. I currently work for [Bounteous](https://bounteous.com) as the **Director of Digital Experience Platforms**(aka backend development and solutions architecture).

I have spend most of the past decade working on the domain of ecommerce; everything on amgr.dev should be considered my own point of view or writing unless otherwise specified; **my opinions are my own and don't reflect the ones from my employers**. 

## Websites

### [AMGR](https://amgr.dev)
This website, which serves as my personal knowledge base and a long content publication. 

### [Coderoncode](https://coderoncode.com)
My technology focus blog, dealing mostly with software development and programming topics.

### [Ecommerce Engineering Podcast](https://ecomeng.dev)

### [Magento 1 PHP Developers Guide](http://magedevguide.com)
Legacy website from my first book mostly maintained for nostalgia rather than use at this point.

## Publications

### Books

#### Magento 1 PHP Developers Guide

**Magento** has completely reshaped the face of **e-commerce** since its launch in 2008. Its revolutionary focus on object oriented and **EAV design patterns** has allowed it to become the preferred tool for developers and retailers alike.

**"Magento PHP Developer's Guide"** is a complete reference to Magento, allowing developers to understand its **fundamental concepts**, and get them developing and testing Magento code.

The book starts by building the reader's knowledge of **Magento**, providing them with the information, techniques, and tools that they require to start their first Magento development.

## Uses This

### Hardware

Overall list of devices and machines that are used for my day to day development and operation.

#### Workstation
As of July of 2018, I use a **hackintosh** that I build myself, 2 ultra-wide monitors mounted one on top of each other and a 27 LG monitor in portrait mode for social media and chats, a Corsair Harpoon RGB mouse, Redragon Kumara with Cherry Reds keyboard which has its keys remapped to work well on MacOS.

The workstation is plugged into a [900W UPS](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000FBK3QK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for protection against Toronto's shady power grip(real problem over winter).
