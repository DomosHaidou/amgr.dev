# Personal

## Work

I'm a Software Engineer who lives in Toronto, Canada. I currently work for [Bounteous](https://bounteous.com) as the **Director of Digital Experience Platforms**(aka backend development and solutions architecture).

I have spend most of the past decade working on the domain of ecommerce; everything on amgr.dev should be considered my own point of view or writing unless otherwise specified; **my opinions are my own and don't reflect the ones from my employers**. 

## Websites

The following is non-exhaustive list of websites that I currently own and I'm actively developing and/or supporting.

### [AMGR](https://amgr.dev)
This website, which serves as my personal knowledge base and a long content publication. 

### [Coderoncode](https://coderoncode.com)
My technology focus blog, dealing mostly with software development and programming topics.

### [Ecommerce Engineering Podcast](https://ecomeng.dev)

### [Magento 1 PHP Developers Guide](http://magedevguide.com)
Legacy website from my first book mostly maintained for nostalgia rather than use at this point.

## Publications

### Books

#### Magento 1 PHP Developers Guide

**Magento** has completely reshaped the face of **e-commerce** since its launch in 2008. Its revolutionary focus on object oriented and **EAV design patterns** has allowed it to become the preferred tool for developers and retailers alike.

**"Magento PHP Developer's Guide"** is a complete reference to Magento, allowing developers to understand its **fundamental concepts**, and get them developing and testing Magento code.

The book starts by building the reader's knowledge of **Magento**, providing them with the information, techniques, and tools that they require to start their first Magento development.

## Uses This

### Hardware

Overall list of devices and machines that are used for my day to day development and operation.

#### Workstation
As of July of 2018, I use a **hackintosh** that I build myself, 2 ultra-wide monitors mounted one on top of each other and a 27 LG monitor in portrait mode for social media and chats, a Corsair Harpoon RGB mouse, Redragon Kumara with Cherry Reds keyboard which has its keys remapped to work well on MacOS.

The workstation is plugged into a [900W UPS](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000FBK3QK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for protection against Toronto's shady power grip(real problem over winter).

#### Laptops

Currently I use two laptops, my daily driver is my original MacBook Pro 15inch 2018 that I been using since early last year, I no longer put client or work related content on this machine, however it still drives note taking, email and side project development.

For office work and business travel I have a similar machine that is compliant with data security policies at my company and is solely dedicated to work related stuff.

#### Reading

For reading I use two devices the primary is a **iPad 9.6inch (6th generation)** which primarily serves as a media consumption device for the following apps:

- iBooks
- getPocket App
- Feedly
- Medium
- Kindle

The second device is a **Kindle Fire 7** which is fairly comfortable for reading as it essentially weights nothing, however its features and overall performance is fairly limited compared to an iPad.

### Software

I run MacOS 10.14 on both my laptops and my custom build workstation, in all cases I'm using a combination of window tiling managers and tools to automatically organize windows. 

I spend most of my programming time using two editors [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/); for writing I'm currently using VSCode as my main editor or Vim depending on the type of writing.

## Profile

This section covers some important things about my personality and a bit of my background short of a biography. Additionally, I added some psychometric information primarily around the [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) mostly for fun as I don't take this kind of tests as an accurate indicator of ones personality.

### Personality

In terms of personality I would classify myself as an introvert with a good amount of social skills. I have taken the Myers–Briggs tests in the past and I have almost consistently been classified as a [Mediator INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality) type.

> Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.
