abstract: Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. As software expands into new and different fields new specialties and disciplines will emerge, in particular I'm interested on the fields of ecommerce and financial technology.

>Software engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software. -- IEEE

Is often said that software is eating the world, software is needed on almost every industry, in every business and even now inside our bodies operating devices like insulin pumps and peace makers. 

And yet Software engineering as a discipline is still not well defined, it has proven difficult to tasks, in fact in many cases Software Engineering is [not considering a real Engineering discipline](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/).

Is important that we start we a solid, comprehensive and agreed definition of Software Engineering; as a starting point we can take the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) definition described in the **Software Engineering Body of Knowledge**.

## Knowledge Areas

According to the [Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge) standard the following are the recognized knowledge areas within the field of software engineering:

### 1. Software Requirements

### 2. Software Design 

### 3. Software Construction

### 4. Software Testing

### 5. Software Maintenance 

### 6. Software Configuration Management

### 7. Software Engineering Management

### 8. Software Development Process 

### 9. Software Quality

### 10. Software engineering models and methods

### 11. Software engineering professional practice

### 12. Software engineering economics

### 13. Computing foundations

### 14. Mathematical foundations

### 15. Engineering foundations


## Sub-disciplines

The following is a non-exhaustive list of Software Engineering sub-disciplines that I consider both emerging and extremely interesting.

### eCommerce 

### Financial Technology (FinTech)
