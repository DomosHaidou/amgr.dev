abstract: When do we know a language? To effectively learn a new programming language one should be capable to understand the basic language and idioms on said language.

# Introduction
My initial impression while learning Scala is that the language is large and complex, it has a times feels like an [eldritch horror](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/eldritch) of a programming language; and yet Scala is quickly becoming an extremely popular language in the industry, and not without good reason. 

> Of course, it’s an exaggeration to say that Scala “isn’t a language”. What Scala isn’t, is a single-idiom language. Scala is both “multi-paradigm”, notably in the sense that it supports both object-oriented and functional programming styles, and multi-idiom, in the sense that it supports the creation of mini-languages tailored for specific purposes. If you’re having trouble finding out what “idiomatic Scala” is supposed to look like, it may be because there are multiple idioms to choose from

In the book [Scala Idioms](https://leanpub.com/scalaidioms) Dominic Fox goes as far as declaring that Scala "isn't a language", the intent behind this bold claim is to highlight that Scala isn't a single-idiom language, in fact, is both a _multi-paradigm_ and _multi-idiom_ and as such defining what "idiomatic Scala" is supposed to look like might be an impossible task.

While Fox's goal was to widely inform his readers about the options and possibilities when working with Scala, my goal is to come up with a deeper understanding of the idioms and design patterns commonly used in Scala and the reason behind them. 

> Generally speaking, a programming idiom is a natural language expression of a simple task, algorithm, or data structure that is not a built-in feature in the programming language being used, or, conversely, the use of an unusual or notable feature that is built into a programming language.

# Breaking down the dialect 

Another way to approach the challenge of learning Scala is to think about it as a language with many different dialects that can be combined at will, as developers our focus should be on learning and understanding these dialects to be able to use the language effectively.
